# time_series_intro

## the code for the "regression analysis of time series" course I teach in 2021S2, in Jupyter notebook using 

* Python,
* Julia, 
* R, 
* Matlab 
* Stata 

## the content of my code is

* W2 : Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive (AR), and ARMA Models
* W3 : ARMA - Model Estimation and Forecasting
* W4 : ARMA - Model Selection and Diagnostics
* W5 : Non-stationary Time Series, Unit Root Tests, and ARIMA Models
* W6 : Forecasting with Seasonality and Cycles
* W7 : Forecasting with Trends and Structural Breaks
* W8 : Modeling Volatility: ARCH and GARCH Models
* W9 : VAR for Multivariate Time Series: Modeling and Estimation
* W10: VAR for Multivariate Time Series: Interpretation and Forecasting
* W11: Cointegration and Spurious Regressions
* W12: More Machine Learning algorithms
